# Performance Optimization Suggestions for FTIR App

## Key Optimizations Implemented:

### 1. Main Application (ftir_app.py)
- **Lazy Import Loading**: Move heavy imports inside functions to delay loading
- **Deferred Initialization**: Use QTimer.singleShot(0, callback) to defer heavy initialization
- **Added Splash Screen**: Provide immediate visual feedback while loading

### 2. UART Control (Controls/uart_control.py) 
- **Reduced UART Wait Time**: Changed from 2 seconds to 0.5 seconds during initialization
- This alone saves 1.5 seconds on startup

### 3. GPIO Control (Controls/gpio_control.py)
- **Background GPIO Setup**: Move GPIO initialization to background thread
- **Non-blocking Initialization**: GPIO setup no longer blocks main thread
- **Safety Checks**: Added checks before GPIO operations

### 4. HomeScreen Optimizations (Recommended)
- **Progressive Widget Loading**: Load widgets progressively instead of all at once
- **Deferred UART Thread**: Start UART thread after UI is ready
- **Staggered Timer Initialization**: Use multiple short timers instead of long delays

## Additional Recommendations:

### 5. Import Optimization
```python
# Instead of importing all at module level:
from Screens.Settings.SettingsScreen import SettingsScreen

# Import only when needed:
def initialize_settings(self):
    from Screens.Settings.SettingsScreen import SettingsScreen
    self.settings = SettingsScreen(self)
```

### 6. Resource Loading
- Consider loading large images/resources in background threads
- Use placeholder images during loading
- Compress large image resources

### 7. Database/File Operations
- Defer file I/O operations until actually needed
- Use async operations for non-critical file access
- Cache frequently accessed data

## Expected Performance Improvements:
- **Startup Time**: Reduced by ~2-3 seconds
- **UI Responsiveness**: Immediate visual feedback with splash screen
- **Background Loading**: Non-blocking initialization of hardware interfaces
- **Progressive Loading**: App becomes usable faster even while background loading continues

## Usage:
The optimized `ftir_app.py` is ready to use. For HomeScreen.py, apply the progressive loading pattern shown in the main app to individual widget initialization.
